GameController

This should always be present in the scene, ideally attached to a GameObject that won't be destroyed between
scenes (but I haven't tested functionality between scenes). 

The GameController is a static class that can be used to access the PlayerController (and through it the player 
actor/controlled actor), LogHelpers, and anything else that should be globally available. 

The LogHelpers (LogPhysics, LogCommands, etc) are called from other classes to log specific information to the
console. The associated boolean values (logPhysics, logCommand, etc) can be enabled/disabled to show/hide 
messages logged through that logger; this allows developers to filter out unrelated log messages when debugging.

    /// Physics logs will display in console if true
